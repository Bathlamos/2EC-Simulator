2EC-Simulator
=============

Given a complete undirected graph with non-negative costs on the edges, the 2-Edge Connected Subgraph Problem (2EC) consists in finding the minimum cost 2-edge connected subgraph (with multi-edges allowed). The simulator allows to find the exact ratio between the ILP and the LP solution for 2EC (also known as integrality gap).
